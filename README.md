# Vortex_phase
This program calculates the phase of vortex light with specified angular momentum L.

In the program, the function is vortex_phase(Nx,Ny,lx,ly,L)
you need to specify the number of grid points (Nx,Ny),the length of the box (lx,ly) as well as the value of angular momentum L.
Nx,Ny should be odd numbers.
